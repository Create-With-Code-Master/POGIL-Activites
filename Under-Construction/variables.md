# Variables

Threshold Concept

A _variable_ is a named "container" that holds a value that can change as the program runs. The name of the variable is the "label" on the container. Knowing the name of a variable allows us to use the value stored in the container without needing to know the actual value.

All values in a program are numbers, patterns of bits. Even values that we see as characters or strings are represented in the program as numbers. Therefore, in C#, we need to specify the _type_ of the variable. We need to tell the compiler how to interpret the bit pattern. They need to be **declared.**

Variables get values by assignment. In C# the _assignment operator_ is the equal sign (**=**). The _expression_ on the right hand side of the equal sign is _evaluated_ and the result is stored in the _memory location_ (container)

Students need to have the concept of binary numbers, to understand that everything a computer does is manipulating numbers.
